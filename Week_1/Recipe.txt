# First, mix 4 ½ teaspoons of green tea powder in 3 tablespoons of hot # water and let cool.
# Then whip 1 cup of cold heavy cream until stiff. Heavy cream contains
# more than 36% of milk fat and should be whipped to stiff without sugar.
# Now mix green tea mixture with ½ cup of cold sweetened condensed milk.
# And add in green tea and (sweetened) condensed milk mixture into   
# heavy cream and fold carefully until combined. Now transfer to a container, plastic or baking pan. And cover with plastic wrap. Then freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight.
